# epics-modules role

EPICS Support modules follow a common structure
and can be built using a standard procedure.

The epics-modules role is a generic role
that installs an arbitrary number of such EPICS modules.

## Selection of modules to build

In the user's `local.yml`, a simple list `epics_modules_list`
defines which modules are built and their build order.

Building the module `base` is mandatory,
as it contains the EPICS build system, which is needed to compile any module.

## Configuration of supported modules

The supported modules are defined in `epics-modules/vars/main.yml`
as a dictionary `epics_modules` of modules
and module-specific parameters.
